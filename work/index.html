      <h3>Labelbox</h3>
      <p class="years">2018 &ndash; 2019</p>
      <p>Labelbox is a training data platform for machine learning applications.</p>
      <p>As the first designer I led an effort that defined a new company strategy. I also led the design and development of the label editor, an online graphics editor tailored to creating ground truth for machine learning applications.</p>

      <img src="/work/dropbox.png"/>
      <h3>Dropbox</h3>
      <p class="years">2014 &ndash; 2017</p>
      <p>During my time at Dropbox, the company was undergoing a strategic transition, switching its core offering from file storage to work collaboration.</p>
      <p>As part of design leadership, I helped grow the design team from 15 to 80 people. I led the design team that were responsible for the core Dropbox experience on desktop, mobile and web. I also helped initiate and lead several early stage product efforts, including a redesign of all Dropbox web apps among others.</p>

      <img src="/work/readmill.png" class="readmill"/>
      <h3>Readmill</h3>
      <p class="years">2010 &ndash; 2014</p>
      <p>A reading app and community for iOS and Android. <a href="http://readmill.com">Readmill</a> had a distraction-free reading experience and easy sharing of marginalia with other readers. The vision of Readmill was to create a shared e-reading experience that honored the rich heritage of the book medium.</p>
      <p>I co-founded Readmill and led product, design and engineering. We sold the company to Dropbox in 2014.</p>
